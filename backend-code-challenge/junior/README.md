## Note:

I am not familiar with using swagger for documentation, this will be my first use of it.

Express is an unopinionated framework and allows flexibility in RESTful API development

Nodejs javascript runtime was used because the bulk of the operation of the API is I/O. it is not computationally intensive otherwise python would be a better fit.

There are several ways to improve the performance of this application, one of which is pagination to reduce network overhead. Another is storing the retrieved data in a temporarystorage like redis sothat further request will not require any external api calls from the backend

## Challenges
I am pressed for time as my current schedule will not allow me to implement any further beyond today, hence the need to submit the project in the current state. But I beleieve I have implemented basic features for a functional api within the project specifications
