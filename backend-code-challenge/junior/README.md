## Note:

I am not familiar with using swagger for documentation, this will be my first use of it.

Express is an unopinionated framework and allows flexibility in RESTful API development

Nodejs javascript runtime was used because the bulk of the operation of the API is I/O. it is not computationally intensive otherwise python would be a better fit.
